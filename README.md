# 370-SideScrollerBP
Date started (and completed): 4/4/2023

How to run: 
- Open project folder and launch the uproject file. 
- When prompted to rebuild modules select "yes". 
- The game <i>should</i> launch on it's own after that, but if nothing happens try running the uproject again and/or building from source. 
- If this is still not working come find me and we can work out what happened, there have been some issues moving between windows and macos versions of UE5 in the past.
- If they haven't been automatically added, add StarterContent files to the project
- Run the project by clicking the "play" button (green triangle) at the top of the editor view window.

Functionality:
- WASD controls to move
- Jump pads that launch the player around the map
